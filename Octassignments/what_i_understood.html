<p>GIT is software used to maintain the versions of project, we can revert toany version that we want at any time.
    It is easy with git to goback to any last commited version,this saves us from manually doing it which takes a lot of time.
    We can also clone the remote repositories so that we can work with them offline and also push the offline work to remote repository so that all those who want to work on it can access those files
