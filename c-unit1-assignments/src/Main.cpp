/*
 Note:
 
 Unit-1 Assignments
 
 Goal is to solve every problem on your own, what ever time it takes.
 Don't be in a hurry, be relaxed and active while solving the problems.
 
 When you don't understand how to solve a problem,
 go to lessons and check the code in lessons' files.
 
 We have assignment questions in these files:
 - Assignment_01.cpp
 - Assignment_02.cpp
 - Assignment_03.cpp
 
 Read each assignment file. Go through the reference links
 to understand the context around problems. Solve the problems.
 
 Expected behaviour of the function is given in the comments.
 So when you think you have written the correct code, but test cases
 are failing, re-read the description of what the function must implement.
 
 When there is no misunderstanding of the problem. You need to start debugging
 your code.
 
 When a test case does not pass, you can right click on the test case and
 select "Debug Selected Tests". Put some break points in your code, and
 see the program in execution, to find out where it is going wrong.
 
 Wish you a joyful coding...
