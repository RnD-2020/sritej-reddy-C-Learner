**GIT** is software used to maintain the versions of project, we can revert toany version that we want at any time.
It is easy with git to goback to any last commited version,this saves us from manually doing it which takes a lot of time.
We can also clone the remote repositories so that we can work with them offline and also push the offline work to remote repository so that all those who want to work on it can access those files<br></br>
:point_down: I also wrote about Markdown <br></br>
MarkDown is used to develop quick good formatted pages or files just like as we do with html.<br /> 
**markdown provides some features to edit text quickly and make it more attractive.**
- '-' use this to get a bullet to the point, use * to get just circle like bullet point symbol.
- write " ** text here ** " to make text into bold style or 'b' between <> just as in html.
- " * text here * " to make text intlo italic style or use 'i' between <> as in html.
- use 'u' between <> to make text underlined as in html. 
- you can also include a URL in a highlighted text using "[text to be highlighted](url here)",
- include images using ![ ]( image address here).
- use "br /" between <> to insert a break to a line. etc..
